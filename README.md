# Mymirror
 Smart Mirror
This is My final project Based on MagicMirror software
The main config file used can be directly cloned to your respective repository.
Modify the default values with your personal values.
I have also attached the modules i have used for this project. These modules are specifally edited and modified for my device so if you
use the same code results may vary.

You can also create your own modules using the info that can be found on : https://magicmirror.builders/



I hope you like my work and get inspired to try out the same.
